    Tabletop RPG Downtime Skill System

    This program assists players in managing their characters' skills during downtime in any tabletop role-playing games.
    It includes functionality to:
    - Add, remove, and rename skills.
    - Improve skills through simulated practice (random dice rolls).
    - Store and retrieve character data (names and skills) from .txt files.

    The program utilizes a 20-sided dice modified random roll for skill improvement and maintains an updated record of character progress in text files.
